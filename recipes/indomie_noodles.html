        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> I've usually bought maggi or yippee and still do (mainly cause it's easily available 
            and costs only about half as much as indomie), but indomie ships with very different flavours 
            and a liquid too that adds a special taste to noodles that neither yippe or maggi can provide 
            (atleast not with any of the flavours they're shipping rn)
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>indomie noodles    -   1 or more</li>
            <li>water       -   as required</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>First and the only step</li>
            <p>follow the instruction on the back of the packet.</p>
            <p>If you're reading this, you don't trust the noodle maker enough to follow 
                their recipe, so here's how you do it.
            <ul>
                <li>boil water, I usually take half a cup and add more as needed</li>
                <li>once the water is boiling, add the noodles to it, stir well. Add more water if required</li>
                <li>once it looks like it's cooked through, add the flavours 
                    <em>(don't add the liquid/soy sauce? yet, that comes after this)</em></li>
                <li>after stirring for a minute or two, pour the noodles into a bowl and add the liquid to it and stir well</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </ul>
