        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Prepare the vegetables</li>
            <p>chop the onions, carrots, tomatoes and garlic into fine blocks</p>
            <li>Sautee the vegitables</li>
            <p>Heat a pan and add oil to it, then add the onions and garlic int it</p>
            <p>Once the onions look golden-ish, add the tomatoes into it</p>
            <li>Boil the pasta</li>
            <p>for 200g pasta, you will most likely need 2 cups of water
                add 2 teaspoons of salt to the water and boil it, one the water is 
                boiling, add the pasta and keep stirring every now and then.
                Drain the pasta(we'll need the pasta water later, don't pour it away)
                and keep it aside 
            </p>
            <li>Add the spices</li>
            <p>The tomatoes should've melted by now, add the carrots and the Ginger
                after a bit, add 1/2 a tablespoon of all the spices into this.
                Add the pasta water to it and keep stirring under low flame
            </p>
            <li>Prepare the cream</li>
            <p>Add a tablespoon of ghee onto a pan and start heating it, add flour
                as required until it looks ground and clumpy, make sure not to burn
                the ghee, add milk as required  after this, the ground matter should 
                mix in fully with the milk, add the rest 1/2 tablespoon pepper to this.
            </p>
            <p><strong><em>Notes - </em></strong> You can add some garlic to it if you want</p>
            <li>Finishing</li>
            <p>Add the cream to the veggies, then a bit of ketchup(if you want)
