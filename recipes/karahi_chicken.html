        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> I got the recipe from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PMmH2-5wJM">Ethan's PK Chicken</a> and found that
            it was more or less the same way I usually cook chicken(main difference being the use of tomatoes instead of onions)
            and tried it out, the result was really nice, spicy with a slight sweetness due to the tomatoes
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tomatoes    -   4</li>
            <li>Chicken     -   500g</li>
            <li>garlic      -   1 clove</li>
            <li>ginger      -   same amount as garlic</li>
            <ol start="i">
                Spices
                <li>Chilli powder   -   1 tablespoon</li>
                <li>Turmeric powder -   2 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Garam Masala    -   2 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Ground cinnamon -   2 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Ground pepper   -   2 teaspoon</li>
                <li>Ground cumin    -   1 teaspoon</li>
            </ol>
            <li>salt        -   as needed</li>
            <li>Onions      -   2 <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Starting with the Chicken</li>
            <p>I get my chicken already cut so I don't need to do anything more except
                wash it a few times. If you don't like bones, you may debone them but
                normally you cook it with the bones. Heat a pan, pour some oil into it.
                As the oil heats up, add the chicken to it and add salt to it at the same times.
                Keep sauteeing? the chicken until it starts turning white.
            </p>
            <li>Adding the vegetables</li>
            <p>Grind the ginger or cut it into tiny pieces and add it to the chicken as it turns 
                while and then after a minute or two, add the tomatoes cut into 4 pieces(you can cut
                into more pieces if you want it to cook faster) and keep sauteeing until the 
                tomatoes start caremelizing
            </p>
            <p><em>Optional step - </em>If you want a bit more gravy, you can chop the onions into fine
            peices and add them along with the ginger</p>
            <li>Adding the spices</li>
            <p>As the tomatoes start to caremelize, add all the spices into it and start mixing.
                You can keep on sauteeing until it feels thick enough, if you want, you can add a bit 
                of water to get more gravy.
            </p>
        </ol>
