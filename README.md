This is a repo hosts the projects I'm given while studying the javascript path at [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com)

At the current moment, I'm reaching the end of the HTML part of the Foundations course, CSS and Javascript comes after this.

Things I've learned upto this point 

- Git basics
- HTML basics
	- Elements, tags, attributes
	- Types of elements are attributes associated with them
	- ??

I intend to be able to create some good looking, functioning websites after this :>
